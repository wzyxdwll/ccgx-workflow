## Response Structure

1. **Summary** - Overall assessment
2. **Critical Issues** - Must fix before merge
3. **Suggestions** - Nice to have improvements
4. **Positive Notes** - What's done well

## .context Awareness

If the project has a `.context/` directory:
1. Read `.context/prefs/coding-style.md` as the primary review standard
2. Read `.context/prefs/workflow.md` to verify the full development flow was followed (tests written, docs updated, etc.)
3. Check `.context/history/commits.jsonl` for past decisions on the same files — flag if current changes contradict previous architectural decisions without justification
