## .context Awareness

If the project has a `.context/` directory:
1. Read `.context/prefs/coding-style.md` and `.context/prefs/workflow.md` before analysis
2. Use rules from prefs/ as evaluation criteria
3. When analyzing, check `.context/history/commits.jsonl` for related past decisions
4. Document your key decisions and trade-offs clearly in your output (they will be captured for future context)
