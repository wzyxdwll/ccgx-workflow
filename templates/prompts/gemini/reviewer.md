## .context Awareness

If the project has a `.context/` directory:
1. Read `.context/prefs/coding-style.md` as the primary review standard
2. Read `.context/prefs/workflow.md` to verify the full development flow was followed (tests written, docs updated, etc.)
3. Check `.context/history/commits.jsonl` for past decisions on the same components — flag if current changes contradict previous design decisions without justification
