# CCG Domain Knowledge — Auto-routing Rules

When the user's request matches trigger keywords below, automatically READ the corresponding skill file to gain domain expertise before responding. These knowledge files are installed at `~/.claude/skills/ccg/domains/`.

**IMPORTANT**: Read the skill file FIRST, then respond. Do NOT fabricate domain knowledge from training data when a skill file exists.

## Routing Rules

1. **Keyword match is fuzzy** — match on intent, not exact string. "How to do SQL injection testing" triggers `pentest.md`.
2. **Multiple matches** — if a request spans two domains, read both skill files.
3. **Language detection** — automatically detect the programming language from file extensions or context, then read the corresponding development skill.
4. **Read once per conversation** — no need to re-read the same skill file within the same conversation.
5. **Skill files are authoritative** — when a skill file contradicts training data, the skill file wins.
